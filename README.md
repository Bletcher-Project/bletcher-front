We offer easy and fast img synthesis depending on your favorite style. Users, we call sketchers, upload their art pieces with their choosen art style created by creators. Our web service provides img synthesis (recreate) by using deep learning technology called GAN. It makes sketchers' art pieces into any style they want to and after they get results from img synthesis (recreate), they can upload recreated art pieces to their own page provided by our own social network service.
